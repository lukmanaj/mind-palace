title: How I started learning Python

I became interested in Python about a year after I started working at Zipline. I just felt that I should have some programming skills since I work with the internet and a laptop almost all the time. I started taking some informal courses on different platforms. 

I remember briefly attempting the 'Data Analysis with Python certification' on Freecodecamp but I never got to complete it. My interest was still there but I never took the next step. I then took the Google Data Analytics certification on coursera where I got introduced to R. After that, I took the IBM Data Science 10-course specialization and I got my first contact with Python. I learnt but I did not practice enough and after a few months, I only knew the basics but I could not apply the concepts to build projects on my own. It was interesting as out of the ten courses in the specialization, five were Python courses:

1. Python for data science
2. Data Analysis with Python
3. Python project for data science
4. Data Visualization with Python
5. Machine Learning with Python

In the end, I didn't have a clear pathway to a future but I am happy that I am now in a fellowship with a community that can support me as I strive to achieve the programming goal. Alhamdulillah.
