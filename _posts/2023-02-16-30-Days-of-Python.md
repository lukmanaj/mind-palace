# 30 Days of Python
As part of the first phase of the Arewa Data science fellowship, the mentors organised a 30 days of Python challenge that consists of exercises tailored to a particular topic per day. Each day offers a challenge on a particular topic in Python. For example, day 5 covers list and exercises of an appropriate hardness level are provided for practice. This is to support understanding of the concept of lists in Python. In addition, the challenge employs a 5 days a week format, since the weekends serve as virtual office hours and can be used to refactor our code and get ready for the next week.

Participating in this 30 Days of Python challenge has given me an avenue to practice the Python concepts I have learnt in the past. Before we began the challenge proper, we were taught how to set up VSCode as an IDE for our Python practice. Afterwards, we were expected to push our daily exercises to the github repository we all made specifically for the challenge. This challenge has significantly improved my Python experience and I am grateful to Arewa Data Science for the opportunity. 

In subsequent outings, I will try to explain my experience going through some of the exercises and also discuss what I learnt in some of the virtual office hours. Not to mention, the MOOC, Learning How to Learn on coursera. Arewa Data Science Fellowship is an interesting addition to my routine with a potential to be life changing.
