I recently started seriously practicing JavaScript, hence this post. Another impact of being a fellow of the Arewa Data Science Academy.
Writing clean and readable code is an essential skill for any JavaScript developer. In fact, for all developers, regardless of favoured language. Clean code is code that is easy to understand, modify, and maintain. It is also code that follows the best practices and standards of the language. In this essay, we will discuss some of the best practices and style guides for writing clean JavaScript code.

1. Use Meaningful Names for Variables, Functions, and Classes
One of the most important aspects of writing clean code is to use meaningful names for your variables, functions, and classes. Your code should be self-explanatory, and the names should reflect the purpose of the code. Avoid abbreviations and acronyms that are not widely known, and use camelCase for variables and functions.

2. Use Consistent Formatting
Consistent formatting is essential for readability and maintainability. Use consistent indentation, spacing, and line breaks. Many style guides recommend using two spaces for indentation and avoiding tabs. Use a consistent brace style, either the "K&R style" or the "Allman style".

3. Use Comments
Comments are an essential part of any codebase. They help explain the code's purpose, how it works, and why it was written. Use comments to describe your functions and classes, to explain complex code, and to document your code's edge cases. However, be careful not to overuse comments or to write comments that simply restate the code.

4. Avoid Global Variables
Global variables can cause a lot of problems in your code. They can create unexpected side effects, make debugging difficult, and make it harder to reason about your code. Instead, use local variables, function parameters, and closures to encapsulate your code and avoid global variables.

5. Use Short Functions and Classes
Short functions and classes are easier to read, understand, and maintain. Try to keep your functions and classes as short as possible, ideally under 50 lines of code. If a function or class is too long, consider breaking it down into smaller functions or classes.

6. Use Error Handling
Error handling is an important part of any codebase. It helps prevent bugs, improve user experience, and make your code more reliable. Use try-catch blocks to catch and handle errors, and use descriptive error messages to help users understand what went wrong.

7. Use Modern JavaScript Features
Modern JavaScript features such as arrow functions, template literals, and destructuring can help make your code more concise and expressive. Use these features whenever possible, but be careful not to overuse them and make your code less readable.

8. Use a Style Guide
Using a style guide can help ensure consistency and readability in your codebase. Some popular style guides for JavaScript include the Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide, Google JavaScript Style Guide, and StandardJS. Choose a style guide that fits your team's needs and preferences and follow it consistently.

In conclusion, writing clean code is an essential skill for any JavaScript developer. Use meaningful names, consistent formatting, comments, avoid global variables, short functions and classes, error handling, modern JavaScript features, and a style guide to ensure your code is clean and readable. With these practices and guidelines, you can write high-quality code that is easy to understand, modify, and maintain.
